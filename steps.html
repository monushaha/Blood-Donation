<h2 class="headinfo">The Donation</h2>
<ul class="ty">
    <li>You arrive for your blood donation appointment.</li>
    <li>Health history and mini physical are completed.
<li>For a whole blood donation, about 1 pint of blood is collected several<br>
   small test tubes of blood are also collected for testing
   <li>Your donation, test tubes and your donor record are labeled with an <br>
    identical bar code label
    <li>Your donation is kept on ice before being taken to a Red Cross center<br>
       for processing; the test tubes go to the lab.

  <h4 class="headinfo">Second Step</h4>
  <h2 class="headinfo">Processing</h2>
<ul class="ty">
  <li>At our processing center, information about your donation is scanned <br>
    into a computer database.
    <li>Most whole blood donations are spun in centrifuges to separate it <br>
      into transfusable components: red cells, platelets, and plasma.
      <li>Plasma may be processed into components such as cryoprecipitate,<br>
         which helps control the risk of bleeding by helping blood to clot.
         <li>Red cells and platelets are leuko-reduced, which means your white <br>
          cells are removed in order to reduce the possibility of the recipient<br>
           having a reaction to the transfusion.
           <li>Each component is packaged as a “unit,” a standardized amount that<br>
            doctors will use when transfusing a patient.
</ul>

<h4 class="headinfo">Third Step</h4>
<h2 class="headinfo"> Testing</h2>
<ul class="ty">
  <li>In parallel with Step 2, your test tubes arrive at a testing laboratory.
    <li>A dozen tests are performed, to establish the blood type and test for <br>
      infectious diseases.
      <li>Test results are transferred electronically to the processing center <br>
        within 24 hours.
        <li>If a test result is positive, your donation will 
          be discarded and you will<br>
          be notified (our test results are confidential and are only shared with<br>
           the donor, except as may be required by law).

        <h2 class="headinfo"> Storage</h2>
        <ul class="ty">
          <li>When test results are received, units suitable for transfusion are <br>
            labeled and stored.
            <li>Red cells are stored in refrigerators at 6ºC for up to 42 days.
              <li>Platelets are stored at room temperature in agitators for up to five days.
                <li>Plasma and cryo are frozen and stored in freezers for up to one year.

                    <li>Hospitals typically keep some blood units on their shelves, but may <br>

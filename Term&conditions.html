        <h1>Terms & Conditions of Blood Donation</h1>
    </header>
    <body>
      <div class="info">
        <pre>
      <div clas="im"> Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic 
       eligibility guidelines:</div>
<div class="age">
<b>Age:</b>
You are aged between 18 and 65.
* In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and 
that appropriate consent is obtained.
* In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries 
 are 60.
</div>
 <div class="weight">
<b>Weight:</b>
You weigh at least 50 kg.    
* In some countries, donors of whole blood donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% .
</div>

<div class="health">
<b>Health: </b>     
You must be in good health at the time you donate.
You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.
If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a 
registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.
If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.
You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation
* A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for 
males as the threshold.</div>
<div class="travel">
<b>Travel: </b>
Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral .
Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified 
countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.
</div>
<div class="behavior">
<b>Behaviours:</b>

<b>You must not give blood:</b>
If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months
Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently: 
Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)
Have ever injected recreational drugs.
* In the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different countries.
</div>
<div class="pregnancy">
<b>Pregnancy and breastfeeding:</b>
Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.
It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after 
your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).
